# Update Venus OS via USB

If you have a blank screen and no ssh access to your Venus OS device this TAR will force an update of your Venus OS (internet connectivity required). ATTENTION: This will delete all existing settings!

1. Download this [`venus-data.tar.gz`](https://github.com/mr-manuel/venus-os_helpful-scripts/raw/master/force-update-over-usb/venus-data.tar.gz).
2. Copy it to a FAT32 formated USB drive.
3. Remove the power from your Venus OS device.
4. Attach the USB to your Venus OS device.
5. Attach the power to your Venus OS device.
6. Wait a few minutes, depending on your internet connection. With a fast internet connection it takes about 5 minutes.
7. Access your device again over HTTP.
